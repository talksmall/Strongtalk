Heavy points are regular allocated Points (as opposed to potentially lightweight immediate SmallPoints).

Note: At this point, all points are actually allocated as HeavyPoints, but this class is here
so that the libraries are all set up for using one of the
remaining undefined immediate tag type for immediate points, which would not have to be allocated, which
would speed up user interface ops somewhat.  We have not decided whether to do this; it would have to 
really be justified.  But points are fundamental and pervasive for UI operations, and are allocated functionally,
which means LOTS of allocation, which immediate points would completely eliminate (for 2D ops).
