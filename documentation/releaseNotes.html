<h1 align="center">Release Notes</h1>

<h2 align="left">Version 2.0</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Fixes by András Páhi: This is the first binary release built from the VM source code recently released by Sun.  Otherwise there is no functionality change.  Before this point, the source code and binary release numbers didn't match because one wasn't built from the other.  From this point forward the version numbers should match.
    </li>

</ul>
<h2 align="left">Version 1.1.2</h2>

<ul>
    <li><p align="left">Fixed inaccuracy in the type system intro
        in tour: private instance methods <em>are</em> visible
        from class methods and vice-versa, when using
        &lt;Instance&gt; and &lt;Self class&gt; types.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">Corrected longstanding documentation error on the history page that failed to credit Dan Ingalls
		for his work on the first attempt at a static type system for Smalltalk.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">Added AssocSet</p>
    </li>

</ul>

<h2 align="left">Version 1.1.1</h2>

<p align="left">(Dave Griswold) This release consists of just a
couple of things that came up shortly after the first public
release to address some issues people were having:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p align="left">A <a href="benchmarking.html">Benchmarking
        Guide</a> has been added to the documentation to help
        people avoid some very common benchmarking traps.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">A bug is fixed in
        Dictionary&gt;&gt;at:put: that caused it to allocate an
        Association even when an entry already exists for the
        key. This was fixed a long time ago, but apparently the
        fix got lost. This speeds up replacing dictionary values
        by about 32%. It ought to be even faster- the code
        generator must not be producing good code for this for
        some reason.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">Support for file-ins in basic Squeak
        format is now supported. This is just for simple classes
        and methods, and has one big caveat: the class must not
        have a class comment. Primarily useful for moving
        benchmarks around. Classes in this format can be filed
        into VisualWorks, too, if you remove the 'stamp:'
        keywords on the method chunk headers.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 align="left">Version 1.1</h2>

<p align="left">This release consists of contributions from</p>

<ul>
    <li><p align="left">David Griswold - lots of different kind
        of cleanup work and enhancements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p align="left">Made it work on Windows XP.
                Command line arg handling was wrong, and lots of
                files were read-only that shouldn't have been.
                DON'T run in a compatibility mode, unless you are
                filing in my 1.1 deltas to 1.0, in which case you
                MUST:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p align="left">First start the 1.0
                        system in Windows 95 compatibility mode.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p align="left">File in my 1.1 code, and
                        save the system</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p align="left">Exit, and turn off
                        compatibility mode</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p align="left">make strongtalk.bst.bak
                        writable (for some reason, compatibility
                        mode cause it to be read-only)</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">Tons of library changes to get
                the core libraries back to (or closer to) being
                fully typesafe. More to do, especially the Stream
                and Visual hierarchies, which I had done a lot of
                work to clean up a long time ago but lost the
                changes, so I am too depressed about it to tackle
                it again right now. But at least the Collection,
                Number and many other critical &quot;Blue
                Book&quot; areas are quite close to being
                typesafe now (most of the remaining problems are
                bugs in the typechecker or in other people's
                code). I will do more on this.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">Fixed an bug in the typechecker
                error display code caused by a postincrement that
                should have been a preincrement. This needs more
                looking at.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">HTML Browser enhancements to make
                the System Tour work, including making it
                possible to view html documents edited (in some
                ways) using Outlook Express.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">Wrote the System Tour and
                reorganized and extended the rest of the
                documentation.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">Added filtering to the hierarchy
                browser. The API can do hierarchy filtering with
                an arbitrary predicate, and the UI has
                convenience interfaces for filtering on common
                library subsets, class comment substrings, or on
                subclasses of a class (which lets you nicely view
                a class' subhierarchy <em>and</em> its superclass
                chain at the same time), or combinations built up
                using AND operators. Filtering is used by the
                system tour to make it easy to view all the
                classes in a subsystem at once, regardless of
                where they are. Look on the context menu for
                subclasses as well as on the pulldown menus (they
                are different). Classes that don't match but that
                need to be shown because they have matching
                subclasses can be distinguished by a different
                font.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">Added support for a source code
                save log, which makes rapid development a whole
                lot easier. To use it, create an empty text file
                in the source subdirectory called
                strongtalkSave.log, and it will accumulate saved
                source code changes, without any changes that
                haven't been saved. Not as good as projects, but
                a whole lot better than what we had before.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">The system now keeps track of
                whether you have made source changes or not, and
                prompts you intelligently to save or not when you
                try to exit. %Bug: Doesn't work for the rare
                things that aren't reflected in the change log.
                Why isn't everything reflected there? You can
                also view all unsaved source changes made during
                a session (See &quot;Browse/Unsaved Changes&quot;
                in Launcher menu).</p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">Changed the Transcript so it can
                show DoIt buttons for system restore after a
                session crash</p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">Added mouse scrollwheel support</p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">&quot;implementers&quot;,
                &quot;senders&quot; and &quot;messages&quot; now
                open a browser directly if there is only one
                match.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">Added Apply button to Definitions
                selection box, so you can quickly browse many
                matching classes.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">Added prompt dialog for category
                name changes for safety.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">added back the missing prims.src
                file (with many changes) so that primitives can
                be typechecked.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">Ctrl-O (open definition) now only
                needs the cursor to be on the name of the
                definition in text- it will try to select the
                range itself.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">Switched browser fonts to ones
                that work with ClearType technology in Windows
                XP. (makes fonts much higher resolution on LCD
                displays- try it!).</p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">added a gross hack because the
                full garbage collection doesn't run automatically
                right now so that we don't run out of virtual
                memory while browsing, by running GC explicitly
                in the browser every time we load a page. I do it
                in a background process that waits 1/4 second
                after page loading so that it hopefully happens
                during think time.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">When creating a new subclass in
                the prog. env. a browser for the new class is now
                automatically launched.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">HTML Browser now supports
                &lt;strong&gt;. Also, headings can now contain
                &lt;br&gt;, images, links, and other phrase
                markup.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">Quitting the system without
                saving changes now automatically reverts the
                source database, so that quitting after unsaved
                changes doesn't leave the source database in an
                inconsistent state (you are prompted to save if
                you want, and you can view the unsaved changes
                from the Browse menu if you want to save them
                some other way). The changes are still recorded
                in the change log no matter what.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">Added a toolbar button to Class
                browers to spawn the superclass.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">Ctrl-Shift-Enter is now a
                shortcut for accept &amp; typecheck in
                TypedCodeViews.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">Turned off smooth scrolling by
                default. This seems to reduce the frequency of
                the occasional hangs people have been having. You
                can turn it on again from the Launcher Dev menu.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">TextViews now automatically
                resize by default. This makes the browsers work a
                lot cooler.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">Fixed that nagging baseline
                alignment bug when imbedding category outliners
                in browser pages.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">*Maybe fixed the hellish
                intermittent temporary hang in the system.
                Guessed it was some kind of deadlock on the
                semaphore protecting the event 'grab' stack, used
                by the region enter/leave managment logic, so
                disabled it by returning a new semaphore anytime
                anyone asks, and haven't had a hang since!
                Theoretically this opens a hole, but the monitor
                was only there for an obscure case that probably
                has never happened anyway (two processes asking
                for the event grab at the same time). Can try
                turning smooth scrolling on again now.</p>

    <li><p align="left">The new dialog boxes I added to keep
        track of whether source changes have been made, only keep
        track of things that modify the change log. Other changes
        (specifically creation of a new category) aren't noticed,
        and don't by themselves cause the quit dialog to prompt
        you. I need to fix this at some point, although it is
        rare to just modify a category without modifying any
        method. -D.G.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">otherwise, same as 1.0</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 align="left">Version 1.0</h2>

<p align="left">This is the original release from Sun
Microsystems, Inc. Most of the work done internally at Sun to get
this ready for release was done by Gilad Bracha and Robert
Griesemer.</p>

<h3 align="left">Bugs/Limitations</h3>

<h4 align="left">System</h4>

<ul>
    <li><p align="left">Doesn't work on Windows XP.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 align="left">UI</h4>

<ul>
    <li>The HTML browser is very limited. It's main purpose is to
        demonstrate smapplets, and to allow active Smalltalk code
        to be integrated into the documentation. If what you see
        is messed up, or if you get crashes or complaints about
        unrecognized tags, try a real browser (or fix the bug!).
        In particular, don't expect to view PDF or run plugins or
        anything like that. </li>
    <li>Color support is ancient and ridiculous. Palette support
        had just been written, but not gotten working, when
        original work on the system stopped. So there are only
        the16 system colors right now (!). I hope to fix this at
        some point soon (D.G.)</li>
    <li>There's a known problem when outliners are opened all the
        way to the bottom, then closed and then redrawn. The
        layout can get messed up. </li>
    <li>Closing a browser (other than a text editor) that has
        unaccepted changes deep down inside doesn't warn you that
        you are about to lose the changes. There is a framework
        for fixing these sorts of issues, but it has never been
        completely applied.</li>
    <li>There is a known memory leak in the Browser caused by the
        fact that a dependency isn't released on closing, which
        causes accumulating dead dependencies in the dependency
        dictionary. Fixing it the right way might be pretty hard
        without weak pointers, although a hack might work.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Programming Environment</h4>

<ul>
    <li>moving a method between a public and private category
        doesn't always update the visibility of the method. As a
        workaround, just reaccept the method once you've moved
        it.</li>
    <li>Someone added an interesting 'meta' hack to easily
        inspect the Application for a window, but this crashes
        the system for some applications, such as workspace.</li>
    <li>Under some more unusual situations the reflective
        interface can corrupt the image, for example sometimes
        when changing the superclasses of all the subclasses of a
        class, then removing the original superclass. If the
        image becomes corrupted this way, you can fix it by
        filing out and then filing in all the affected code,
        which forces it to be rebuilt.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Type system</h4>

<p>There are a variety of shortcomings and bugs in the
typechecker, but here are some of the main ones you may
encounter:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Unions often don't work right. You may encounter error
        messages that say things like &quot;[^Boolean | Boolean]
        is not a subtype of [^Boolean]&quot;</li>
    <li>Sometimes the error messages are cryptic or apparently
        unrelated to the real problem. This is usually due to
        cascading errors.</li>
    <li>There are some error display bugs that may cause crashes.</li>
    <li>inherited types don't work right now.</li>
    <li>&quot;typecheck world&quot; in the launcher crashes right
        now.</li>
    <li>&quot;typecheck all classes&quot; in hierarchy browser
        doesn't produce the same results as typechecking all the
        classes individually right now; not sure which one is
        right. this needs to be fixed.</li>
