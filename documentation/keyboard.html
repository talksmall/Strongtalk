<h1 align="center">Keyboard Usage</h1>

<h4 align="left">Important Keys</h4>

<ul>
    <li>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-O opens a browser on the declaration of the
        global identifier that the text cursor (or selection) is
        on. </li>
    <li>When entering text a browser or other multiline textview,
        you can accept the text by pressing
        &lt;Ctrl&gt;-&lt;Enter&gt;. You can accept and typecheck
        the code at the same time by pressing
        &lt;Ctrl&gt;-&lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Enter&gt;, and any type
        errors in the method will show up in a listbox right
        under the textview. Clicking on each type error will
        highlight where it occurs in the code. In single line
        textviews, &lt;Enter&gt; accepts the text.
        (Unfortunately, you can't enter typed code in Workspaces
        right now; the error display machinery currently needs to
        be in a method browser).</li>
    <li>&lt;Escape&gt; cancels text editing, and restores the
        text to its original value.</li>
    <li>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-Z is 'Undo' in text views. You can undo as
        many changes as you have made, back to the last accept.
        Redo is supported as well, but it is available only from
        the context menu.</li>
    <li>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-E will scroll as necessary to make the input
        focus maximally visible.</li>
</ul>

<h4 align="left">Normal Stuff</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Strongtalk is a real Windows application, with real
        Windows widgets imbedded here and there, so most of the
        usual things work, such as &lt;Alt&gt; to get to the
        pull-down menus.</li>
    <li>&lt;Tab&gt; lets you traverse the hierarchy of widgets
        that will accept the input focus, and
        &lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Tab&gt; works the same way in reverse.
        You can also use &lt;Ctrl&gt;-&lt;Tab&gt; and
        &lt;Ctrl&gt;-&lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Tab&gt;, which work even
        in text fields where Tab would change the text.</li>
    <li>The normal Windows cut/copy/paste keys work
        (&lt;Ctrl&gt;-X,&lt;Ctrl&gt;-C,&lt;Ctrl&gt;-V,
        respectively). They just manipulate text right now.</li>
    <li>Page-up and Page-down scroll the innermost scrollbars
        containing the input focus. So if there are multiple
        nested scrollbars, you can usually choose which one
        scrolls by moving the input focus around.</li>
</ul>

<h4 align="left">Executing Smalltalk Code</h4>

<ul>
    <li>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-D performs a doIt on the current selection
        (executes the code). If nothing is explicitly selected,
        the default is intelligently chosen: from the beginning
        of the most recent line before the cursor that has no
        whitespace at the beginning of it, through the end of the
        line the cursor is on. In other words, you can execute a
        multi-line doIt without selecting it first, as long as
        the first line of the doIt starts at the left margin,
        subsequent lines have whitespace at the beginning, and
        the cursor is on the last line of the doit.</li>
    <li>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-I does an inspectIt on the current selection
        (executes the code and opens an inspector on the result).
        If nothing is explicitly selected, selection works the
        same as for doIt.</li>
    <li>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-S does a showIt on the current selection
        (executes the code and prints the result in-line). If
        nothing is explicitly selected, selection works the same
        as for doIt. Unlike other Smalltalks, the result is not
        just text, even though it looks like it. It is an
        imbedded object showing the printstring. Clicking on it
        will open an inspector.</li>
    <li>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-B converts the selection into a Button
        imbedded in the text, which you can click on whenever you
        want to execute the code. A cool generalization of doIts.</li>
    <li>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-F does a fileIn on the selection.</li>
</ul>
