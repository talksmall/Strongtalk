<H1>The Strongtalk Type System for Smalltalk</H1>

<H5>Gilad Bracha</H5>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>The benefits of static typechecking in software development are widely
recognized. It is now feasible to introduce static typechecking into Smalltalk
in a manner that does not compromise the flexibility of the language or
the programming environment. This document describes <B><I>Strongtalk</I></B>,
a type system well suited to this purpose. The Strongtalk type system is
designed to ease the development process by improving the reliability and
readability of programs during development, maintenance and use. The type
system provides an enforceable formalism for describing the interfaces
of Smalltalk libraries. This formalism helps designers communicate to themselves
and to others the interfaces of classes. In addition, Strongtalk helps
catch errors earlier in the development process. The type system is <I>not</I>
concerned with improving execution performance, since it is based on interface
types. Optimization requires concrete implementation type information.
Agesen \cite{Agesen96} has demonstrated that extracting concrete type information
in Smalltalk-like languages does not require linguistic extensions. Therefore
concrete types are not considered here. Since Strongtalk provides a language
for describing interfaces to humans and machines, it is by definition a
language extension. However, use of the type system is completely optional.
The following section briefly describes the specifics of the type system.
The later sections discuss the type system's interaction with other language
features, its implementation and experience in its use. </P>

<H3>The Type System</H3>

<P>This document is too brief to give a complete specification of the Strongtalk
type system. Here we can only provide an overview of Strongtalk's salient
characteristics and a summary of its features. For a more detailed description
(though somewhat out of date) see [<A HREF="#oopsla93">BrachaGriswold93</A>].
The key characteristics of the Strongtalk type system are : </P>

<UL>
<LI>The type system is <I>expressive</I> enough to allow natural Smalltalk
idioms to be typechecked. To accomplish this, Strongtalk:</LI>

<OL>
<LI>Separates the subtype and subclass lattices. </LI>

<LI>Includes parameterized types and classes. </LI>

<LI>Supports parametrically polymorphic messages, with a flexible mechanism
for automatically inferring actual type parameters. </LI>

<LI>Supports both subtyping and type matching. </LI>

<LI>Preserves the subtype relations between classes defined by the Smalltalk
metaclass hierarchy and relates them to the types of their instances. </LI>

<LI>Provides facilities for dynamic typing. </LI>
</OL>

<LI>The type system preserves <I>encapsulation</I>. This means that internal
changes in classes to do not effect clients. This is itself a desirable
property. Additional advantages include: </LI>

<UL>
<LI>The system does not require access to the internals of a class or method
in order to typecheck their usage (including inheritance). Consequently:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>The system can be used even if source code is unavailable.</LI>

<LI>The system can be used even if source code cannot be statically typechecked.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>It is much easier to produce a responsive incremental implementation,
which is a de facto requirement for any Smalltalk programming environment.
</LI>
</UL>

<LI>The type system is <I>optional</I>. This means the developer is free
to choose: </LI>

<UL>
<LI>Which code to typecheck, if any. </LI>

<LI>When to typecheck code, if ever.</LI>

<LI>Where to add type annotations, if at all.</LI>
</UL>

<P>There is a continuum of choices representing different costs and benefits
associated with different levels of typechecking. One extreme is not typechecking
any code at any time, and using no type annotations. This amounts to using
a traditional Smalltalk. Another extreme is annotating all code, and always
typechecking all of it. This is very much the way one uses a traditional
statically typed language. Neither extreme is optimal, but the main point
is that each developer is free to choose. For typechecking to be truly
optional, the dynamic behavior of a Smalltalk program must not be influenced
by any type annotations attached to it. This is not a trivial requirement.
Many statically typed languages have constructs that violate this constraint.
Examples include implicit dynamic type checks (as in Beta or Eiffel) or
overloading (as in C++ or Java). As a consequence of optional typechecking,
the type system does not restrict the set of programs expressible in the
language. If typechecking is required, this is impossible as a matter of
principle, for reasons of computability. </P>

<LI>The system provides the same kind of <I>reflective</I> access to type
information as Smalltalk does to other language constructs. Note that if
a program does access type information reflectively, then by definition
its behavior is dependent on the type annotations in it.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>Details </H3>

<P>We summarize the features of the Strongtalk type system here. </P>

<UL>
<H4>Protocols </H4>

<P>Strongtalk separates types from classes. The type hierarchy is defined
using <I>protocols</I>. A protocol is a collection of message selectors
and their associated <I>signatures</I>. A message signature specifies the
types of a message's arguments and its return type. Every class <TT>C</TT>
automatically induces a protocol, known as <TT>C protocol</TT>. In type
expressions, no ambiguity can arise as to whether a name denotes a class
or a protocol, so we elide the selector <TT>protocol</TT>, and refer to
<TT>C protocol</TT> as just <TT>C</TT>. One may also define protocols independently
of classes. Protocols are created by protocol inheritance, just as classes
are created by class inheritance. All protocols inherit from <TT>Object
protocol</TT>, just as all classes inherit from <TT>Object</TT>. Since
every class also induces a metaclass <TT>C class</TT>, and every class
induces a protocol, it follows that every metaclass induces a protocol
which is referred to as a <I>class protocol</I>. Naturally, the protocol
for <TT>C class </TT>is <TT>C class protocol</TT>. In type expressions,
one can always elide the word <TT>protocol</TT>, and refer to the protocol
of the metaclass as <TT>C class</TT>. In a protocol, the type variable
<TT>Self</TT> refers to the type of the receiver. <TT>Self class</TT> then
represents the type of the class of the receiver. In the case of class
protocols, the receiver is a class, and we may wish to refer not only to
the type of the receiver and the type of the receiver's class, but also
to the type of the receiver's instances. This can be done using the type
variable <TT>Instance</TT>. Every protocol definition induces a class protocol
representing the type of the class of objects which support the protocol.
The class protocol hierarchy parallels the protocol hierarchy, just as
the metaclass hierarchy parallels the class hierarchy. Thus, all class
protocols inherit from <TT>Object class protocol</TT>, just as all metaclasses
inherit from <TT>Object class</TT>.</P>

<H4>Typed Methods and Expressions</H4>

<P>Smalltalk is extended syntactically so that all variable declarations
may be annotated with a type declaration. This includes temporaries, block
and method arguments, instance, class, pool and global variables. All methods
have an associated return type. If no return type is explicitly declared
then <TT>Self</TT>, the type of the receiver, is assumed. Methods may be
declared to take type arguments. These are never passed in explicitly,
but are inferred. The visibility of a method may be either public (the
norm) or private (in which case the method is only visible within the class
and its subclasses). A private method does not appear in the classes' protocol.
Classes may include <I>message declarations</I>, indicating messages that
must be supported but are not implemented. In practice, subclass responsibility
methods may be used for this purpose. Classes may be declared <I>abstract</I>,
meaning that they include message declarations. The system can then ensure
that classes that are not abstract implement all their message declarations.
</P>

<H4>Genericity</H4>

<P>Definitions such as classes and protocols can be declared to be <I>generic</I>.
A generic abstracts over one or more types. Typical examples are the classes
in the <TT>Collection</TT> hierarchy: </P>

<PRE>Collection[T] {Object subclass ...} </PRE>

<PRE>Set[E] {Collection[E] subclass ...} </PRE>

<P>A generic definition introduces one or more formal type arguments. These
variables can be used in the scope of the definition. To be used in a type
safe manner, a generic must be invoked with actual type arguments (e.g.,
<TT>Collection[Character], Set[Boolean], Dictionary[Symbol, Integer]</TT>).
Occurrences of the formal type arguments are replaced with the corresponding
actual type arguments. A bound can be specified for each formal type argument
<TT>T</TT>. If no bound is given, <TT>T</TT> is assumed to be a subtype
of <TT>Object</TT>.</P>

<H4>Block Types</H4>

<P>A special syntax is provided for the types of blocks. <TT>[^Symbol]</TT>
is the type of a block with no arguments that returns a symbol. <TT>[Character,
^ Integer]</TT> is the type of a block that takes a single character argument
and returns an integer. <TT>[Boolean, Integer, ^Boolean]</TT> is the type
of a block taking two arguments, a boolean and an integer and returning
a boolean result. <TT>[X, ^Object]</TT> can be written more concisely as
<TT>[X]</TT>. Similarly <TT>[Boolean, Integer, ^Object] = [Boolean, Integer]</TT>.
<TT>[^Object]</TT> can be contracted to <TT>[]</TT>.</P>

<H4>Union Types</H4>

<P>One may specify the type of an object as the union of several object
types, (e.g.,<TT> Symbol | UndefinedObject</TT>). </P>

<H4>Parametric Polymorphism </H4>

<P>In some cases the type of a method's result may depend on the type of
its arguments. To accurately express the signatures of such methods one
may use <I>parametric polymorphism</I>. A parametrically polymorphic method
signature introduces one or more formal type arguments which can be used
throughout the signature and the method body. When the message is sent,
the actual types will be inferred and replace the formal type arguments
in the signature. As an example, consider the signature of <TT>Collection[T]&gt;&gt;collect:</TT>
: </P>

<PRE>collect: blk &lt;[T, ^X def]&gt; ^ &lt;Collection[X]&gt;</PRE>

<P>The type term <TT>X def</TT> introduces a type argument <TT>X</TT>,
which will be inferred to be the type returned by the block which must
be the first argument to the method. A typical usage would be </P>

<PRE>| nums &lt;Collection[Integer]&gt; |</PRE>

<PRE>nums := 'Fee Fi Fo Fum' collect:[:c  &lt;Character&gt; | c asciiValue]. </PRE>

<P>Here <TT>X</TT> will be inferred to be <TT>Integer</TT>, and the type
of the send is <TT>Collection[Integer]</TT> as expected. </P>

<H4>Relationships among types </H4>

<P>Strongtalk supports two relations on types: <I>subtyping</I> and <I>matching</I>.
Subtyping implies substitutability: an element of a subtype can be safely
used wherever an element of a supertype is expected. Matching implies a
common pattern of self reference. Originally, Strongtalk relied on a structural
type system augmented with brands. The current version abandons brands
and uses declared relations to determine subtyping and matching. Every
protocol definition specifies its supertypes. Likewise, a class definition
can specify the supertypes of its protocol. By default, a protocol is declared
to be a subtype of its superprotocol. Naturally, every declared type relation
is verified by means of a structural check. Subtyping among invocations
of a given generic is declared as follows. Each formal type argument has
a <I>variance</I> which determines how the type of an invocation varies
with the type of the actual type argument supplied. If the formal is <I>covariant</I>,
then <TT>T &lt;= S ==&gt; G[T] &lt;= G[S]</TT>. If it is <I>contravariant</I>
then <TT>T &lt;= S ==&gt; G[S] &lt;= G[T]</TT>. If it is <I>unrelated</I>
(the default) then no subtype relation is declared between <TT>G[T]</TT>
and <TT>G[S]</TT>. Subtyping of block types is contravariant on the argument
types and covariant on the range type. </P>

<H4>Essential Type rules </H4>

<UL>
<H5>Message send </H5>

<P>The message selector must be defined for the type of the receiver. The
types of arguments in a message send must be subtypes of the types of the
formal parameters. The type of the send is the return type of the message
signature being invoked. </P>

<H5>Assignment</H5>

<P>The type of the right hand side of the assignment must be a subtype
of the type of the variable being assigned. The type of the assignment
is the type of its right hand side. </P>

<H5>Return statement </H5>

<P>The type of the expression being returned must be a subtype of the declared
return type of the enclosing method. The type of the return statement is
<TT>DoesNotMatter</TT>, which is a subtype of any type. </P>

<H5>Method body </H5>

<P>The return type of a method that does not execute a return must be a
supertype of <TT>Self</TT>.</P>

<H5>Subclassing</H5>

<P>A method signature in a subclass must always be a matchtype of its signature
in the superclass. The types of variables cannot change. Inherited public
methods cannot be privatized. </P>
</UL>
</UL>

<H3>Interaction with Existing Language Features</H3>

<P>Since the type system is optional, the extension does not interact with
existing language features. Strongtalk is both upward compatible with Smalltalk
(since any Smalltalk program is a Strongtalk program) and downward-compatible
in the sense that any Strongtalk program can be trivially converted back
into a Smalltalk program by stripping out the type annotations.</P>

<H3>Implementation Issues</H3>

<P>Strongtalk can be integrated into an existing implementation by modifying
the programming environment so it can parse and typecheck type-annotated
programs. No changes are needed to the underlying compiler or runtime because
the type system is optional. </P>

<H3>Implementation Status and Experience</H3>

<P>An implementation that integrated Strongtalk into an existing browser
was demonstrated at OOPSLA 93, and used in production in the financial
industry. A second generation implementation has since been developed using
completely new browsers that take fuller advantage of the type system.
Strongtalk has been used to write several large libraries, including a
complete blue book base library implementation. The implementation has
the highly desirable property that it imposes no overhead unless the typechecker
is actually invoked. When the typechecker is used, memory overhead is small,
and incremental response is good. Experience using Strongtalk has supported
most of the assumptions of the original type system design. In particular:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Even if a library is not typechecked, typechecking its clients is feasible
and beneficial, as long as a library interface has been defined. </LI>

<LI>Type annotation enhances readability of code. </LI>

<LI>Typechecking can actually ease the development process. It detects
many bugs that otherwise show up during debugging, but faster. Also, the
type system occasionally detects problems that lurk in working code for
extended periods of time.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The most important change introduced into Strongtalk is the move from
structural to declaration based subtyping. This change was made because:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Structural type descriptors do not express programmer intent, and are
difficult to read. </LI>

<LI>Error messages produced by structural checking are poorly localized
and very hard to understand. This is especially true in a large system
with lots of internal cross references like Smalltalk. </LI>
