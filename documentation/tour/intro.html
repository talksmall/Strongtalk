<p>Note: This tour is designed to be viewed using the Strongtalk browser, not a regular html browser, because it contains Smalltalk code.</p>
<h3 align="left">Introduction</h3>

<p align="left">The Strongtalk system is a fundamental redesign
of the Smalltalk-80 system. While maintaining the basic syntax
and semantics of the Smalltalk-80 language, it contains
significant advances in a variety of areas relative to previous
Smalltalk implementations, including:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p align="left">a virtual machine that executes Smalltalk
        <em>much</em> faster than any other implementation,</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">the first workable strong, static type
        system for Smalltalk (use of which is completely optional
        and incremental, and which does not affect performance),
        as well as a typed &quot;Blue Book&quot; library,</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">a flyweight, glyph-based user interface
        that nonetheless allows integration of native widgets,
        and which provides automatic layout using Tex-style
        &quot;shrink/stretch&quot; semantics,</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">native threads with both synchronous and
        asynchronous (non-blocking) C callouts, and</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">an advanced, outliner-based programming
        environment</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">use of mixins to provide a simple,
        elegant alternative to multiple inheritance</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p align="left">This document is designed as a tour of the unique
aspects of the Strongtalk system for researchers and serious
Smalltalkers, so it assumes a solid understanding of Smalltalk
systems and their architecture. It gives just enough tutorial
information so that you can browse around the system, and
otherwise dives right into cool nitty-gritty stuff.</p>

<h4 align="left">How the Strongtalk System Came About</h4>

<p align="left">The system is based on many years of work by a
variety of people, starting with pioneering research done by the
Self group at Sun Microsystem's Labs as well as at Horizon
Technologies, Inc.. The current system was developed in secret at
a small startup company, Animorphic Systems (officially LongView
Technologies, Inc.), that was started in 1994. Unfortunately for
Strongtalk, the rapid and unexpected (by anyone, I think) rise of
Sun Microsystem's Java forced Animorphic to halt work on the
Strongtalk system before it was ever released. Animorphic was
acquired by Sun Microsystems in 1997, and parts of the Animorphic
virtual machine technology became the core of what is currently
Sun's production Java virtual machine implementation.</p>

<p align="left">Because of this history, very few people have
ever gotten their hands on the Strongtalk system, although
rumours have floated around about it for years. Fortunately, Sun
Microsystems has recently graciously agreed to release the
Strongtalk system as unsupported software, so that the research
and Smalltalk communities can finally get their hands on it. The
released system includes full source code for all Smalltalk
source code under a Berkeley-style open source license, and a
&quot;Wintel&quot; binary for the virtual machine under a free,
non-commercial use license (Note that I don't work for Sun
Microsystems any more, and so don't speak for them and didn't
decide on that policy).</p>

<p align="left">At the point at which initial development stopped
on the Strongtalk system, it was running quite nicely in
pre-alpha release form. However, it was certainly not completely
finished, and so of course there are a fair number of messy
corners still in the system, although on the whole the system is
surprisingly robust. Many of the messy corners are actually
pretty easy to clean up, and I for one will be doing a bit of
that. The fact that the VM allows C callouts without modification
or relinking of the VM means that virtually any part of the
libraries can be changed and extended. <em>All</em> user
interface and I/O code is in Smalltalk.</p>

<p align="left">The Strongtalk system was developed by (in
alphabetical order): Lars Bak, Gilad Bracha, Steffen Grarup,
Robert Griesemer, David Griswold, and Urs Hoelzle. Special thanks
to the members of the Self group for their pioneering VM
research.</p>
