<h3 align="left">Experimental Fast Floating Point</h3>

<p align="left">One of the classic performance problems in
Smalltalk is the performance of double-precision (64 bit)
floating point operations. This is due to the fact that all
numbers are objects in Smalltalk, and on current machines object
references are 32 bits, with 1 or 2 bits reserved for tag bits,
which is far too small to encode a double-precision floating
point value. This is not a problem for integers, since 30 or 31
bits is plenty to represent numbers up to at least 1 billion. But
a single precision floating point value with tag bits subtracted,
which is all you can fit into an immediate object reference, has
far too few digits of precision (about 7) for most floating point
applications. Thus, they have to be allocated as real objects,
and this causes a massive performance penalty of one or two
orders of magnitude for double-precision floating point
calculations, since a new object must be allocated for the result
of every operation.</p>

<p align="left">The Strongtalk system includes an experimental
scheme for performing fast double-precision arithmetic without
allocation. This scheme was not developed very far, and has
several drawbacks and limitations:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p align="left">It requires use of a special
        &lt;FloatVal&gt; type annotation that is <em>not</em>
        integrated with the type system, although it uses the
        same syntax. If this syntax is not used, normal allocated
        double precision operation is used.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">It requires explicit conversion between
        boxed (allocated) and unboxed (optimized) doubles, and
        does not allow passing of unboxed doubles across method
        boundaries.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p align="left">However, if a significant number of operations
are combined in a single method, it can produce huge speedups by
eliminating all the allocation for intermediate results. Click
<a DOIT="Mandelbrot new launch">here</a> to launch a primitive sample application that uses fast floating point
to compute the Mandelbrot set. Use the
&quot;Control/Compute&quot; menu item to run the program. You can
compare the performance relate to both normal Smalltalk
&quot;boxed&quot; floats, and to a C routine, using the options
menu. The compute time in milliseconds is printed in the
Transcript.</p>
