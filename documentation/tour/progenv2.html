<h2 >The Programming Environment (cont.)</h2>

<p align="left">The Strongtalk programming environment (mostly
written by Steffen Grarup; Gilad Bracha added the typechecking
stuff) is quite different than the ones in traditional Smalltalk
systems. It uses an <em>outliner</em> design, where
constructs are represented in an indented, bullet-list tree
format, which is familiar to users of Windows Explorer, and other
similar programs. This format has several advantages, including
the fact that it allows you to see the whole interface for a
class at once, and open multiple methods at the same time in the
same browser.</p>

<p align="left">To understand the Strongtalk system, it will be
helpful to have a relatively small, self-contained application to
examine, that uses many of the major features of the system. So
let's use use the Strongtalk HTML browser itself for this
purpose. This browser, which is the same one that you should be
viewing this tour in, is very primitive, and doesn't have the
right architecture for a full-blown HTML browser. It can't even
support http at the moment, so it is only good for viewing pages
on the local disk (its only excuse is that it was written in a
few weeks when Lars Bak bet me I couldn't write one in less than
two weeks. I lost the bet). However, it is a real application; it
is written in Strongtalk; it is typesafe; it is written in a
normal Smalltalk style; and it uses most of the basic libraries
as well as the UI libraries. So it is not a bad application to
look at if you want to see how the Strongtalk system 'feels' in
use.</p>
<h3 align="left">Hierarchy Browsers</h3>
<p align="left">Below is a Hierarchy Browser on the HTML browser
classes. Note the description &quot;Filter: %HTML with
subclasses&quot;. What this means is that we are filtering the chosen hierarchy
(I chose the whole Object hierarchy here) for classes whose comment contains the
string '%HTML', and their subclasses. You can also see their
superclasses, in a less bold font. You can open or close
individual levels of the hierarchy by pressing on the <img
src="resources/closedItem.bmp"> or <img
src="resources/openItem.bmp"> buttons, respectively.
If you right-click on any item, you can see its context menu. To
see any subhierarchy in its entirety, choose &quot;Expand All
Levels&quot; from its menu. To open the hierarchy all the way
down in one step, press the
<smappl visual="
	Button
			withImage:  (Image fromFile: (FilePath for: 'resources/openAll.bmp'))
			action: [ :b | 	
							b	promptOk: 'Not that one- the one on the toolbar!'
								title: ''
								type: #info
								action: []] 
"> button on the toolbar.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="center">
<smappl visual="
	| h v |
	h := (ClassHierarchyOutliner for: (ClassMirror on: Object)) 
    								filterOnCommentsContaining: '%HTML';
    								orSubclasses.
    v := (h topVisualWithHRule: false)
		withBorder: (Border standard3DRaised: true).
    v
">
	<br><strong>Class Hierarchy Browser on HTML classes</strong>
			<a DOIT=" (ClassHierarchyOutliner for: (ClassMirror on: Object)) 
    									filterOnCommentsContaining: '%HTML';
    									orSubclasses;
    									launch
			">(spawn)</a>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the hierarchy browser above is imbedded inside another
application, the menu for the browser as a whole is the context
menu for the top-level entity, Object. Normally browsers have a
window to themselves, in which case their top-level menu appears
as the usual pull-down menu. Try pressing 
<em>spawn</em> above to launch a copy of the
browser in its own window. </p>

<p>In the browser you opened in its own window, try looking at
the 'Filtering' menu, to see how filtering works. If you turn off
filtering, the whole Object hierarchy appears. You can filter on
any comment substring, or on subclasses of a particular class,
and you can use AND to look for multiple comment strings. You can
also include all subclasses of the current filter.</p>

<p>At the top of the filtering menu you will find pre-constructed
filters that let you look at commonly browsed library subsets,
such as &quot;User classes&quot;, which shows all the classes
that users normally reference during coding. Try filtering on
&quot;Blue Book classes&quot;, and then doing &quot;expand
all&quot;. This will let you see at a glance where all the
familiar classes from the Blue Book reside in the library. Note
that filtering hides all subclasses that don't match the filter;
if you want to see <em>all</em> the subclasses of the Blue Book classes,
choose &quot;with subclasses&quot; from the Filter menu, and then
&quot;expand all&quot; (<smappl visual="
	Button
			withImage:  (Image fromFile: (FilePath for: 'resources/openAll.bmp'))
			action: [ :b | ] 
">) again. Also note that file-out, typecheck,
etc. all operate on the set of filtered classes, which is very
convenient for saving or typechecking an application by itself.
This is easy to set up for new applications, simply by adopting
the convention of having some known tag string in your class
comment.</p>

<p>Now let's open a class browser on the main class for the HTML
Browser, which is HTMLView. To do this, just press on the class
name in the hierarchy browser, and then continue to the next page of the tour.</p>
