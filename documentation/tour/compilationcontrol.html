<h2 align="left">Examining Compilation and Controlling Compiled
Code</h2>

<h3 align="left">Looking at Compiled Code Space Usage</h3>

<p align="left">The fact that the compiler inlines and customizes
methods means that methods can potentially have many compiled
versions, each in a different inlining or customization context.
This brings up an important point: it would seem like this might
consume a large amount of space for compiled code. In practice,
the opposite is true: the system uses a remarkably small amount
of space for compiled code. This is because only performance
critical code is optimized, and most systems spend most of their
time running a quite small set of performance critical code, as
mentioned before. </p>

<p align="left">You can tell the VM to print a summary of the
compiled code space usage, which appears in the console window
(not the Trancript). This is done using the
&quot;System/Compiler/Print Compiled Code Space Usage
(Zone)&quot; menu item on the Launcher. The first number is the
total size of the compiled code space, including unused space.
The size of this area is fixed at startup, but can be changed
using the CodeSize option in the <a
doit="(CodeEditor on: (FilePath for: '.strongtalkrc')) launch">.strongtalkrc</a>
startup options file. The third line contains the most important
information, which is the number of compiled top-level methods
(not counting methods inlined into them), and how much space they
use. Typically compiled code occupies 1-3 megabytes for a
programming session.</p>

<h3 align="left">Showing Compilations</h3>

<p align="left">You can tell the VM to show every method it is
compiling, which is an interesting way to watch the adaptive
optimization process in action. This is done by selecting
&quot;System/Compiler/Print Compilations&quot; from the Launcher
menu.</p>

<h3 align="left">Changing the Compilation Threshold</h3>

<p align="left">The threshold at which code is considered to be
performance-sensitive, and thus compiled, can be changed. This is
done by setting a different value for InvocationCounterLimit in
the <a
doit="(CodeEditor on: (FilePath for: '.strongtalkrc')) launch">.strongtalkrc</a>
file. This value is 10000 by default. The number indicates the
number of times a method or loop body must execute before the
compiler tries to produce an optimized version of that code (and
perhaps the calling and called code too). Increasing this value
will cause a smaller amount of compiled code to be compiled, and
decreasing it will cause more code to be compiled. The
performance effect of changing it is not so obvious. The most
performance critical code will be compiled for almost any
reasonable value, so peak performance is not affected. Code that
is marginally performance sensitive is the most affected by
changing the limit. Increasing the limit also has the effect of
making the system somewhat more stable, since less of the system
is compiled.</p>

<h3 align="left">The Inlining Database</h3>

<p align="left">Because of the adaptive nature of the compiler,
the compiled code naturally differs depending on the way that the
system is being used. Thus, subtle changes in the way that a user
interacts with the system can cause slightly different
optimization results. For production application deployment, this
may not be a desirable feature, since the exact compiled code
produced can vary every single time the system is run, and that
may make the testing team uncomfortable.</p>

<p align="left">To deal with these sorts of issues, the
Strongtalk VM is capable of storing in an external directory
structure the exact inlining format that the system is using, and
can be told to reuse that same inlining structure on subsequent
runs. This can make the performance of the system more
predictable, and in fact, you can even turn off all compilation
for any method not in the inlining database, so that the compiled
code is virtually identical between runs. Or, you can allow the
compiler to run normally, in addition to using the inlining
database.</p>

<p align="left">To create an inlining database, you run the
system until you have the system in a state where the code you
care about has been optimized. Then, you dump the inlining
database using the Launcher menu item
&quot;System/Compiler/Create Inlining Database&quot;. This will
create a directory called &quot;Inlining&quot; under the
strongtalk home directory. The directory contains a subdirectory
for each class that has optimized code associated with it, and in
those directories there is a file for each optimized method,
containing the inlining structure in the same format we saw on
the previous page.</p>

<p align="left">Once you have created an inlining database, there
are several flags that control the inlining database operation.
These flags are in the <a
doit="(CodeEditor on: (FilePath for: '.strongtalkrc')) launch">.strongtalkrc</a> file.
The options have either a + before them to enable them, or a - to
disable them.</p>

<ul>
    <li><p align="left"><strong>UseInliningDatabase</strong>:
        this option indicates whether or not the inlining
        database should be used.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><strong>UseInliningDatabaseEagerly</strong>:
        this option indicates whether the inlining database
        should be used eagerly or not. When this flag is off, the
        inlining database is referred to only when a method has
        been used enough to become performance critical, and it
        is then compiled using the database inlining structure.
        When the database is used eagerly, two things happen: the
        method is compiled using the inlining database structure
        immediately the first time it is invoked, and a
        background process starts when the system starts up to
        eagerly compile all the code in the inlining database.
        Eager use of the database can cause the system to start
        up a little bit slower, since compilation happens
        up-front, but the system then reaches top performance
        much sooner and more predictably than when using the
        database lazily.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><strong>UseRecompilation</strong>: This
        flag actually isn't directly for the inlining database,
        but it interacts with it. This is the master flag that
        tells the system whether to compile performance critical
        code. If this is off, the system runs in interpreted
        mode, except for any methods in the inlining database (if
        it is enabled), which are the only ones optimized. If the
        compiler is on, then the optimizer runs normally,
        although the inlining database is referred to for those
        methods it contains.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p align="left">The inlining database is also a great tool for
exploring exactly what the adaptive compiler has done. Try
dumping the inlining database and looking at its contents if you
are interested in the adaptive compiler. One important thing to
note is that sometimes there is no entry in the database for a
method you are sure is performance critical. This can happen
because the inlining database may have inlined that method into
the body of some <em>other</em> calling method instead, so it may
not need its own top-level compiled method. Adaptive optimization
may compile many different versions of a method, either
customized for different subclasses, or inlined into different
optimized calling methods.</p>
