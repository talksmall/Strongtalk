<h2>A Two-Page Introduction to the Strongtalk Type System</h2>

<h4><strong>David Griswold</strong></h4>

<p>First of all, a clarification: the name Strongtalk, originally
used in an OOPSLA paper in 1993, referred just to the type
system, which was originally grafted onto what was then ParcPlace
Smalltalk. The name was later adopted for a far larger system,
which includes the optimizing virtual machine, new &quot;Blue
Book&quot; libraries that have been completely reimplemented to
accomodate a number of goals in addition to type-safety, a new
user interface framework, and a programming environment, as well
as a second-generation implementation of the type system. The two
are distinguished by referring either to the Strongtalk
&quot;system&quot;, or the Strongtalk &quot;type system&quot;.</p>

<p>You will see a lot of type annotations as you browse around
the system. A complete introduction to the type system is far
beyond the scope of this tour. Right now, I will give you a crude
two-page summary of the type system. Don't get intimidated; just
read it and the simple examples should make the basic ideas
clear. Once you've finished these two pages, you can read just
about any type annotation in the system and get the basic idea (A
copy of a somewhat more detailed workshop presentation by Gilad
on the type system is <a href="../type-system/nwst.html">here</a>).
There should be some more formal documentation on the type system
soon.</p>

<p>The main ideas to keep in mind are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The type system is based on declared support for <em>protocols</em>.
        Protocols can either be implicitly defined by a class
        interface, or explictly defined with a separate name
        (which is useful for keeping class-side messages out of
        the protocol, or other kinds of abstraction).</li>
    <li>All type expressions are delimited by <strong>&lt; &gt;</strong></li>
    <li>All variables have a type annotation, so that method
        arguments, local variables, block arguments, etc are each
        followed by a &lt;...&gt; expression.</li>
    <li>It supports generic types, using the syntax <strong>SomeProtocol[TypeA,TypeB,...]</strong>
        This allows you to use types like &lt;<strong>Collection[Str]&gt;</strong>
        (Str is a declared alias in the the libraries for the the
        read-only string protocol ReadString, that both Strings
        and Symbols support. Unmutated strings are so commonly
        used that Str is a useful shorthand. Note that in the
        Strongtalk libraries, Symbols can be fully substituted
        for Strings, if you don't plan on modifying them, which
        doesn't work in some other Smalltalks). You can define
        both generic protocols and generic classes.</li>
    <li>Message or method return types are indicated with a
        leading <strong>^</strong>, for example <strong>^&lt;Int&gt;</strong>
        means a message or method returns an integer. I am using
        the words message and method distinctly because we
        declare methods in classes (implementations) whereas
        message just refers to the method's signature, which can
        also be declared in a protocol without a method body.</li>
    <li>Block types have their own syntax; for example the block <strong>[3]</strong>
        has the type <strong>&lt;[^Int]&gt;</strong>, meaning the
        block produces an integer (Int is a declared alias for
        Integer). Argument types come before that, separated by
        commas, so that the block <strong>[ :s &lt;Str&gt; | s
        size ]</strong> has the type <strong>&lt;[Str,^Int]&gt;</strong>,
        meaning it takes one Str argument and produces an Int. If
        you don't care about the value type of the block you can
        omit it, in which case it is Object by default.</li>
    <li>Here is a whole method so you can see how types are used:<pre>
aMessage: aStringBlock &lt;[^Str]&gt; ^&lt;Int&gt;
    | result &lt;Int&gt; |
    result := aStringBlock value size.
    ^result</pre>
        <p>This is a method that takes (a block that produces a
        Str), and returns an integer.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
