<ul>
    <li><p align="left"><strong>Fast Floating Point:</strong> The
        virtual machine contains optional highly experimental
        support for fast (unboxed) double-precision (64 bit)
        arithmetic. This is just an experiment, but if you are
        interested you can read more about it <a
        href="fastfloats.html">here</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><strong>Debugging Support:</strong>
        Debugging support is fairly rudimentary right now. There
        is no graphical debugger, however, invoking #halt will
        bring up a graphical stack examination window that lets
        you see the stack and inspect method receivers and
        arguments. From the menu of the stack examination window,
        you can select &quot;Process/Transfer to console
        debugger&quot; to invoke a command-line debugger that
        will let you single step through the code.</p>
        <p>It is unfortunate that we didn't have the time to
        write a graphical debugger, since one of the really neat
        features of the inlining virtual machine is that it
        provides an exceptionally nice environment for debugging.
        This is because the ability of the VM to dynamically <em>deoptimize</em>
        methods even while they are executing means that it is
        trivial to make inlining and other optimizations fully
        transparent to the debugger. As soon as you halt or
        single-step, the VM reverts to the interpreted version of
        just the methods you are in on-the-fly, providing full
        interpreted semantics for debugging. Called methods can
        remain fully optimized, and as soon as you continue, the
        normal optimization process reoptimizes the code.</p>
