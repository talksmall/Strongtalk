<h2 align="left">How Adaptive Optimization Works (cont.)</h2>

<h3 align="left">The second step: Adaptive native-code
compilation</h3>

<p align="left">Once an invocation counter reaches a
predetermined threshold, the code associated with it becomes a
candidate for optimization. This happens only for a very small
fraction of the code in the system, but it is exactly that
fraction of the code that the system spends most of its time
executing. Typically, it only takes a fraction of a second for
performance-critical code to reach this threshold.</p>

<p align="left">Because only a small fraction of the code in the
system is optimized, we can afford to do more optimization on
that code. This is true in both space and time: we can afford to
do extensive inlining, which consumes more space, and we can
afford to spend more time generating good code. The Strongtalk VM
currently has a rather simple code generator- the possibilities
for improvement are large. A considerably better code-generator
was written for the system, but it had not been sufficiently
tested to be included in the release.</p>

<p align="left">Because of the two-phase nature of execution,
when the native code compiler is invoked on a piece of code we
know not only that the code is frequently executed, but we know a
lot about what kinds of receiver classes have been encountered
for each send in that code, because of the inline-cache
information described above. This information can be used to
drive optimization.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Optimistic Inlining: </strong>The
fundamental enabling optimization used is <em>optimistic inlining</em>.
An optimistic optimization is one that requires that a predicted
property of the code remain true in the future for it to be
successful (or correct). For example, if a send is monomorphic,
the VM might try to optimistically inline just the single method
that has been invoked in the past, and assume following that
inlined section that only that method has been invoked (which
lets you do better optimizations <em>after</em> the inlined
send). This is optimistic, because usually we cannot guarantee
that at some point in the future we might suddenly encounter
other receiver classes for that send.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Deoptimization: </strong>Optimistic
inlining of this type requires an adaptive mechanism to <em>deoptimize</em>
the code on-the-fly if an optimistic assumption is violated-
otherwise the optimization will actually be incorrect, not just
inefficient. For example, if we inline a monomorphic message
whose invoked method always returns an Association, the compiler
may perform optimizations in addition to the inlining based on
the fact that the returned value is known to be an Association.
But if at some point a method other than the inlined one is
invoked by that send, the subsequent assumptions about the return
value can become invalid, and the optimized code <em>cannot</em>
be used. The Strongtalk VM detects these cases on-the-fly, and
actually modifies activations in-place on the stack to revert to
the safe, interpreted form of execution, in the middle of
optimized method execution. Thus, the ability to do
deoptimization is critical to enabling aggressive optimization.</p>
