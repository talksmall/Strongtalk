<h2 align="left">How Adaptive Optimization Works</h2>

<p align="left">The basic concepts involved in how the Strongtalk
VM works have been published or discussed publically in the past,
and are discussed here. The basic idea is very simple: a
two-phase execution system is used, with the first phase
determining which code is frequently executed. The second,
optimizing phase is invoked only for frequently executed code.</p>

<p align="left">This takes advantage of a well-known property of
programs: most programs spend the vast majority of their time
executing a very small portion of their code. By only optimizing
performance critical code, extensive inlining and optimization
can be done, which would cause too much overhead in code space
and compilation time if it were done on the whole program.</p>

<h3 align="left">The first step: Instrumented Interpretation</h3>

<p align="left">Just as in other Smalltalks, source code is
compiled into a portable byte-code format that is kept in the
image. When the code is first executed, it is interpreted, as in
an interpreted Smalltalk. But the similarities end there. The
interpreted code is <em>instrumented</em> in several ways, to
determine the execution characteristics of each section of code.
This is done with two measurement techiques:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p align="left"><strong>Invocation Counters:</strong>
        Counters are used to keep track of how many times each
        method is called, and how many times each loop iterates.
        This is used to determine how performance-critical each
        section of code is.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><strong>Inline-caching:</strong><em><strong>
        </strong></em>Each message send is instrumented to
        determine what methods are invoked by that send. There
        are three important cases that are distinguished:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p align="left"><strong>Monomorphic Sends:</strong><em><strong>
                </strong></em>A monomorphic send is one that only
                ever invoked for one receiver class during
                execution. This does not mean that it can't
                invoke others in the future- it only means that <em>up
                to this point</em>, the send has only been
                invoked with a single receiver class (perhaps
                many times). The VM keeps track of this class
                using a standard <em>inline-cache</em>. The vast
                majority (over 90%) of dynamic sends fall into
                this category.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left"><strong>Slightly Polymorphic
                Sends:</strong> A slighly polymorphic send is one
                that invokes one of a very small number of
                receiver classes, but more than just one. The VM
                keeps track of the small set of receiver classes
                using a <em>polymorphic inline-cache</em> (PIC).</p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left"><strong>Megamorphic Sends:</strong>
                A megamorphic send is one that has many different
                receiver classes, too many to keep track of. Very
                few sends fall into this category.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p align="left">The smaller the number of receiver classes
invoked by a send (called the <em>arity</em>), the easier it is
to optimize it using inlining in the second phase. An important
associated technique called <em>customization</em> is used to
help reduce the arity of sends, so that more of them can be
optimized. Customization works by making copies of
performance-critical methods for each concrete subclass, just as
if inheritance were treated as a form of code copying. Many sends
can become monomorphic after customization. For example, a
self-send in a superclass method would not ordinarily be
monomorphic, because self can be any one of a number of different
subclasses. But if a copy of the method is made for every
subclass, then each copy only ever has one class for self, and
thus all self sends become monomorphic.</p>
