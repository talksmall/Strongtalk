<h2 align="left">The Virtual Machine</h2>

<p align="left">Perhaps the most striking difference between the
Strongtalk system and other Smalltalk systems is performance. The
Strongtalk system is not only far faster than any other Smalltalk
system (and it is hardly tuned at all), but it is faster in ways
that can significantly improve the way that Smalltalk programmers
write code. This is because it dramatically reduces (and often
completely eliminates) the cost of most message sends and blocks.
This allows programmers to write even the most performance
critical code in as finely-factored a way as they please. For
example, accessor messages for instance variables, and custom
control structures (using blocks), can be used universally.</p>

<p align="left">This may sound too good to be true, but it really
works. The Strongtalk virtual machine accomplishes this feat
using several different technologies:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p align="left">A fast interpreter combined with a unique
        dynamically-adaptive inlining compiler that produces
        native code. The compiler uses <em>type feedback</em>, an
        approach developed by Urs Hoelzle for his Stanford
        doctoral thesis as part of research done in the Self
        group at Sun Microsystems, Inc.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">A very fast generational garbage
        collector</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">Direct pointers for objects, eliminating
        object table indirections</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p align="left">The inlining compiler can inline and optimize
away over 90% of dynamically occuring message sends and block
closures. Since most programs spend almost all their time in a
small fraction of their code, the compiler is able to keep the
space and time cost of optimization reasonable by only optimizing
performance-critical code.</p>

<p align="left">On the next page we will show a micro-benchmark
that demonstrates the dramatic effect of this technology. For
those who are interested, you can read a two-page overview on <a
href="optimization.html">how the adaptive compilation process
works</a> before proceeding to the next page.</p>
