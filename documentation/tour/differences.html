<h2 align="left">How does Strongtalk relate to Smalltalk-80?</h2>

<ul>
    <li><p align="left">Strongtalk is a true Smalltalk that also
        provides an optional static type system. It
        adheres as closely as possible to modern Smalltalk-80
        syntax and semantics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p align="left">The standard method syntax is
                supported, with some enhancements so that type
                annotations are also allowed.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">Full block closure semantics are
                supported, with local variables allowed in any
                block.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">The only hard-wired messages are
                the critical Boolean messages, such as
                ifTrue:..., whileTrue, etc. Other Smalltalks also
                hard-wire these, as well as others that are not
                treated specially in Strongtalk.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">The normal mixed-mode arithmetic
                semantics are supported, as well as infinite
                precision integer arithmetic.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">The normal class/metaclass
                semantics are supported. However, inside the VM,
                all classes are actually constructed from <em>mixins</em>,
                which adds flexibility.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">Global and class variables are
                supported, but class <em>instance</em> variables
                are not (although we had planned to add them).
                Pools are not supported. Shared variables that
                would be in Pools in other Smalltalks are just
                kept in class variables and accessed via class
                messages in Strongtalk. This does not entail a
                message-send performance penalty as it would in
                other Smalltalks, since messages to literal
                classes (or self) are constant messages and can
                be inlined away by the Strongtalk compiler.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">Indexed instance variables
                support is provided for objects, bytes, and
                double-bytes, although they are not specified as
                part of the class constructor as in other
                Smalltalks. Instead, support for them is added to
                a class by <em>mixing in</em> one of several
                special system mixins.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">#become: is not supported. The VM
                represents objects with direct pointers, rather
                than an object table, and while this increases
                system performance for most objects, it would
                make #become: prohibitively slow. So for example
                Collections that need to grow hold internal
                Arrays, etc.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p align="left">Blocks support #ensure:, to
                provide important stack-unwind protection.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">The library interfaces (instance and
        class interface semantics as well as concrete class
        names) conform as closely as possible to the Smalltalk-80
        libraries <em>in areas used by model code</em>. In other
        words, code that uses the core Collection classes and
        other basic data structures should be able to run
        virtually unchanged. User access to processes appears
        almost the same, with fork, Semaphores, Processor, and
        SharedQueues all working as expected (the system uses
        native threads and the libraries are designed to work
        with preemptive scheduling, but Processes are currently
        scheduled non-preemptively).</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">Although the Strongtalk VM performs many
        fancy optimizations, it still supports the kind of
        interactive program creation and modification that helps
        make Smalltalk so unique. The intention is to make
        optimizations invisible to users (except for speed, of
        course!). This requires an enormous amount of
        sophistication and infrastructure in the VM, because all
        the different customized and inlined versions of a method
        must be found and fixed up dynamically as the code
        changes. The programming environment is bootstrapped in
        the same image as the user's code, as in other
        Smalltalks.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left">The class hierarchy is structured
        somewhat differently than in Smalltalk-80. This is for
        two reasons: 1) the core Strongtalk classes are
        strongly-typed, which requires more structured
        inheritance relationships, and 2) Strongtalk supports <em>mixins</em>,
        so for example strings are able to mix-in Magnitude
        support, even though they are not subclasses of Magnitude
        (since not all Collections are Magnitudes). However,
        concrete class names are the same, so that for example,
        while Dictionary is a subclass of HashedCollection rather
        than Set as in Smalltalk-80, Dictionary can still be used
        the same way it normally would in most user code. The
        stream instance protocols are pretty much the same,
        although the stream class names and hierarchy are very
        different. This should not matter much as most code does
        not create streams directly from Stream classes, but by
        asking some lower-level object (a collection, a file,
        etc) to create the stream instead.</p>
