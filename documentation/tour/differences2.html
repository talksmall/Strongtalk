<h2 align="left">How Strongtalk relates to Smalltalk-80 (cont.)</h2>

<p align="left">In areas of the library not normally used by
model code (i.e. user interface, reflection, file reification,
portability framework, image management, etc), we decided to feel
completely free to innovate, so these areas are much different:</p>

<ul>
    <li><p align="left"> <strong>UI</strong>: The user-interface is designed to allow
        much more finely-grained widgets, with full support for
        imbedding native widgets. For example, the line of text
        you are reading is actually a general GlyphRow full of
        individual CharacterGlyph widgets that draw themselves.
        Here is a real, live, imbedded MS-Windows button, to show
        that any widget, including native ones, can be put
        anywhere: <smappl visual="
	Button
			labeled: 'Press Me!'
			action: [ :b  |	
							b	promptOk: 'The UI can do native things easily, through a portable interface.'
								title: 'It works!'
								type: #info
								action: [] ]
"> </p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><strong>Reflection</strong>: Reflection is done with <em>mirrors</em>
        (a concept borrowed from Self), so that the system does
        not have to go through an object's interface to reflect
        on it, as in other Smalltalks. This means that objects
        are free, for example, to override #class so they can
        closely mimic some other kind of object, and this won't
        break system code or inspectors, etc, since they don't
        use those messages.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><strong>Constructors</strong>: Because of the type system and mixins,
        Strongtalk must support more top-level constructs and
        more independent options for their constructors than other Smalltalks. For
        example, there are also protocols and type aliases. Also,
        classes and protocols can be generic or non-generic, classes can be
        abstract or concrete, classes need to be able to
        declare what protocols they support, and superclasses may 
        have <em>mixins</em> applied to them. All of this severely
        strained the 'constructor message to the superclass'
        approach used by other Smalltalks, so a more flexible
        declarative constructor framework was devised. It is
        normally hidden by the programming environment, but it
        means that the file-out format is different for top-level
        constructs, although it still uses the same 'chunk'
        format as other Smalltalks.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><p align="left"><strong>Images</strong>: Image management is very different. This
        is due to observation of the problems that many new
        Smalltalk programmers have when they are introduced to
        images. The first problem is that they try to use images
        as an actual database for their production application
        data, which images are completely unsuited for. A
        second problem is that deploying a program as an image
        means that you can never quite be sure what
        history-dependent state got mixed in with your program.
        So most programmers end up always having to do extra work
        to build a fresh image before testing and delivery, to be
        sure that there isn't some state floating around the
        image they weren't aware of. A third problem is that
        objects that relate to the outside world (i.e. file
        editors, open file descriptors, database connections,
        etc) can easily end up corrupted or in the wrong state,
        unless complex management code is written to fix them up
        when an image is restored.<\p> </p>
        <p>So in practice, images are really only useful as a
        convenient way for developers to keep the state of their
        programming environment between sessions. In Strongtalk,
        we use an external HTML start page that can hold
        Strongtalk browsers and code, to fulfill this function.
        The image itself is <em>declarative</em>, meaning that it
        only contains the program declarations themselves, with
        no variable state. This way, delivered programs always
        behave predictably, and start in a state defined solely
        by the program code.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Portability</strong>: The Strongtalk system uses a different approach to
        portability than some other Smalltalks. Some other
        Smalltalks use a completely portable image with platform
        specific code pushed out into the VM. And Squeak, for
        example, also implements the entire VM in Smalltalk, with
        a later translation to C before execution. We did neither
        of these things. At the image level, we wanted to be able
        to integrate tightly with native user interface
        facilities, so we designed portable UI interfaces that
        are implemented in a platform-dependent way in Smalltalk
        (all UI and I/O code is written purely in Smalltalk). For
        the VM, we felt it was simply too risky to try to
        bootstrap our VM in Smalltalk, although the idea was
        discussed. Strongtalk was not a research project, and we
        were writing a fancy optimizing compiler that had to be
        very fast, much more so than existing dynamic
        translators, in order to not cause significant pauses
        during compilation. So the VM is implemented in C++
        (although the bytecode compiler is written in Smalltalk,
        as in other Smalltalks).</li>
    <li><strong>Type system</strong>: And of course, Strongtalk includes an incremental,
        interactive typechecker, which is integrated into the
        programming environment. The typechecker is completely
        written in Smalltalk, and does not interact with the VM
        at all. The libraries are almost completely annotated
        with types, although the extent to which typechecking of
        the libraries had been completed at the time development
        stopped varies considerably. This was primarily due to
        bootstrapping issues: the typechecker, for example, had
        to be written before it could be typechecked, and it is
        much harder to typecheck large bodies of code <em>after</em>
        they have been written. The core library, including the
        Blue-Book classes and the UI framework, have been
        extensively typechecked. The programming environment has
        been mostly typechecked.</li>
